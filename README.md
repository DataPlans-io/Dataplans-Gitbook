## What is DataPlans.io?

Upon the release of the iPhone XR / XS, it became obvious that digital SIMs would replace physical SIM cards and that delivery of digital SIMs would be different than the physical logistics of SIM card sales.&#x20;

To serve the digital delivery of SIM cards, we created Dataplans.io as an API platform for digital SIM Card delivery giving resellers an ability to add digital SIM cards to their sales process.

## What does Dataplans.io API do?

The API is a delivery method for SIM resellers to sell eSIMs via on demand requests, removing the need for keeping inventory.  Currently the API delivers eSIMs from [AIS](esim-products/ais-sim2fly-esims.md) and [DTAC](esim-products/dtac-thailand-tourist-esim.md), with more eSIM products to be added.

## Who is Dataplans.io?

The team behind [MobileTopup.com](https://mobiletopup.com), a service providing mobile credit to phones worldwide, set up DataPlans, LLC.  With over 10 years of experience of selling mobile phone credit, delivering a mobile data option was a natural next step.



## Who can use Dataplans.io?

Dataplans.io is a wholesale eSIM sales platform, great for SIM card resellers, travel agents, travel kiosks and ATMs.&#x20;

Using the live ordering requires acceptance of the [User Agreement](https://dataplans.io/user-agreement/) and additionally KYC will be requested in order to satisfy [NTBC](https://www.nbtc.go.th) requirements on SIM card sales.  As such we will require real names, copies of government issued ID of the account principle and company registration documents.

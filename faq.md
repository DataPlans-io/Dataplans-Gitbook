# FAQ

## &#x20;What kind of support do you provide?

We provide support in issues involved with delivering a valid eSIM code.  Issues to do with connectivity, speed and performance will be the responsibility of the carrier.&#x20;

## After purchasing, when does data plan start?

The data plan **starts upon the first data usage** in a supported country.

## Can a eSIM be returned?

eSIM QR codes contain a single use code, that if used, is no longer able to be reused.  Therefore, unless we can fully confirm and eSIM code is unused, we can not accept any returns.&#x20;

## After adding the eSIM, how long do I have to use it ?

In most cases, You have 60 days after adding the eSIM to your phone to make first data usage.

## Can eSIMs be moved between devices?

AIS -Yes.   DTAC - No.  We can provide our customers with a eSIM re-issue form, to request a new QR.&#x20;

## What payment methods do you accept?

For credit deposits into the platform we accept several methods.  The platform currency is **Thai Baht**.&#x20;

### Credit Cards

You can pay with a credit or debit card.  We use [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) with USD charging, and give you the equivalent platform credit. Any processing fees are excluded from the deposit amount.   You can choose a **One Time Payment** or save and add your card for **Auto Recharge** upon low balance.&#x20;

We recommend an amount of 1000 Baht for each time the balance falls below 500 Baht.
